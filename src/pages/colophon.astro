                A little bit about myself.
            </h1>
            <p>
                As a Engineer Manager (which on a Scrum perspective you can think of it as a Scrum Master role) my goal
                is to create a environment where people feel good to work on. It is one of my principles that feeling
                good about your work - and your work environment - is the base for creating a high performant team.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, creating - or changing - the team culture might take some time. That are a lot of things you
                need to iron out. I rely on the work of <a href="https://calnewport.com/" target="_blank">Cal
                Newport</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/" target="_blank">Scrum</a> methodology to create a high
                performant team whose team members enjoy working on.

                    As an Engineering Manager at Community Archives since 2022, I have been leading a diverse team of
                    software developers in delivering high-quality, innovative solutions that meet our clients' needs.
                    My
                    role involves overseeing all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from initial planning
                    and
                    requirements gathering to development, testing, and deployment. I work closely with cross-functional
                    teams, including product management and design, to ensure that projects are delivered on time and
                    within
                    scope. In addition, I am also focused on team development and growth. I mentor and coach team
                    members,
                    helping them set and achieve professional goals, and providing regular feedback to support their
                    career
                    progression. I am committed to creating a collaborative and inclusive work environment where
                    everyone
                    feels empowered to contribute their best ideas.

                    During my time as a Back-end developer at TownSq, I specialized in designing, developing, and
                    maintaining scalable microservices applications. My role involved writing clean, efficient, and
                    well-documented code, primarily in languages such as Java and Node.js (Typescript). I collaborated
                    closely with front-end developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to understand
                    requirements
                    and translate them into software solutions. I was responsible for managing databases, optimizing
                    queries, and ensuring data integrity, working with NoSQL databases (MongoDB). My work also included
                    implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, integrating third-party services/vendors,
                    and
                    deploying applications to cloud environments on AWS.
