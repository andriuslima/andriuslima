                A little bit about myself.
            </h1>
            <p>
                As a Engineer Manager (which on a Scrum perspective you can think of it as a Scrum Master role) my goal
                is to create a environment where people feel good to work on. It is one of my principles that feeling
                good about your work - and your work environment - is the base for creating a high performant team.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, creating - or changing - the team culture might take some time. That are a lot of things you
                need to iron out. I rely on the work of <a href="https://calnewport.com/" target="_blank">Cal
                Newport</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/" target="_blank">Scrum</a> methodology to create a high
                performant team whose team members enjoy working on.
            </p>
